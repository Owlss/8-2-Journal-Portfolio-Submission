# 8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Submission
My client for this class was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their clients. Artemis Financial were seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications.


I was good at looking over the codes securtiy. It's important to code securely so that you reduce the chance of exposing the code to vulnerabilites. Software Security adds safety and protection to a company's wellbeing, as well as giving them peace of mind that their information is safe and secure.


I found that the errors I found where the hardest part of the project to deal with. They impacted my abilty to complete the code.


I chose some of the most vulnerable layers in the client's project and fortified those layers to increase the strength of the code's weakest link. In the future, I would spend more time on all of the code not just some layers


I ensured the code and application were functional and secure by performing rigorous static and dynamic testing on the code to ensure every use case was handled and that none of the dependencies could be exploited. After refactoring the code, I ran through the same test cases to make sure everything was still safe and operational.


I mainley used the maven dependency checker.

I might consider showcasing my use of Dependency checkers to a future employer to show that I am competent with finding vulnerabilities within a codebase.
