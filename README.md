Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app was created to track user-made goals and allow them to be reminded of them. It was designed to help people accomplish goals they would otherwise put off. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Three screens were needed for the app, a home login screen , a settings screen, and a task screen. My app kept users in mind by design based on the Android app standards for design 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I coded the app much in the same way that I coded most of my other projects, not using any special techniques or strategies.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I did not test my code to its fullest extent, this process revealed to me how much work I have left to do 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate to keep track of the content on each screen. I drew out each screen with its components to be able to track this. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

It shows that I have a basic understanding of android studio but still have a lot of work to do when it comes to the backend
